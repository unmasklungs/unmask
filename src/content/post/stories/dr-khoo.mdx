In early 2020, I was diagnosed with stage 1 lung cancer coincidentally after routine follow-up for an unrelated chronic condition found a series of abnormalities. The news was shocking, especially for someone who sees the devastating effects of cancer on patients every day. I am a Medical Oncologist at the British Columbia Cancer Agency - Kelowna and I also Clinical Assistant Professor at University of British Columbia. We were all in the throes of the COVID pandemic at the time. I eventually had surgery to remove the cancer later that year and had half my right lung removed. When the pathology report came back confirming lung cancer, it just dawned on me that it could be radon related.

Why should I have lung cancer? I had no known risk factors for lung cancer. I then discovered we live in an area known to have some of the highest radon levels in Canada and in fact the world. I immediately tested my home of 25 years. I was shocked to find home radon levels consistently higher than Health Canada’s guideline level of 200 Bq/m³ (becquerels per cubic metre).

The irony of the situation isn’t lost on me. Lung cancer is one of the most preventable types of cancer. I should have tested and acted years ago to protect myself and my family. Once we confirmed the high radon levels, I took steps to reduce them through a process called radon mitigation. It’s so relieving and reassuring knowing that our home is now safe. We are so grateful to all the health care providers and radon professionals on my lung cancer journey.

I am grateful to have caught my cancer early and had it successfully removed. I feel compelled to share my story to raise awareness about the life-threatening risks of radon. I wouldn’t wish this diagnosis on anyone. I urge every homeowner to protect their family’s health by checking for radon and taking any required mitigation measures. Together, we can prevent lung cancer and protect our loved ones from this silent danger.
