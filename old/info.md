Ambassador Policy Recommendations   
This edition of Citizens for Radioactive Radon Reduction (CR3) shares the powerful stories of eight radon 

ambassadors from across Canada, many of whom believe their lung cancer diagnosis was connected to the high levels of radon they found in their homes. These brave advocates share their experiences in the hope that they encourage other Canadians to take action and test their homes for radon. 

**THESE BRAVE ADVOCATES SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE HOPE THAT THEY ENCOURAGE OTHER CANADIANS TO TAKE ACTION AND TEST THEIR HOMES FOR RADON.** 

Radon gas exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer and is connected to the deaths of over 3,300 Canadians every year. Colorless, 

odorless, and tasteless, radon gas is produced as a by-product of uranium breaking down in the soil. Radon seeps into homes through cracks in the 

foundation or other openings, and every home in Canada contains some level of radon. The question is- how much? The only way to know is to test your home. 

We asked these eight patient advocates for their perspectives on radon policy in Canada, and what recommendations they would provide to the federal government to improve radon support, education, and regulation in the country. Their recommendations provide a comprehensive patient perspective on urgent issues regarding radon gas exposure and lung cancer, and solutions to amend them. 

**RADON GAS EXPOSURE IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF LUNG CANCER AND IS** 

**CONNECTED TO THE DEATHS OF OVER 3,300 CANADIANS EVERY YEAR.**

**Ambassador Policy Recommendations** 

To protect Canadians from radon gas exposure, the lung cancer ambassadors and patient advocates featured in this magazine have shared the following policy recommendations: 

**SUPPORT** 

**1** 

**2**   
Establish a program where **radon mitigation companies travel to remote** areas so that several homes in these rural areas can be mitigated simultaneously. 

***\~Kelly*** 

**Improve radon awareness and provide more financial support** at the federal level, for individuals wanting to test and/or mitigate their homes to help protect 

Canadians from radon gas exposure. 

***\~Kerri*** 

**3** 

**EDUCATE 4**   
Protect citizens by **making radon testing mandatory and providing relief to families** so everyone can live in healthier environments.  

***\~Luana*** 

**Increase radon awareness initiatives.** Many Canadians do not act because they are not educated on radon. Lung cancer treatment has cost Canada a lot of money in medical fees, and it could be avoided by **shifting priorities towards** 

**radon education and prevention.** 

***\~Christine*** 

**5 6**   
**Educate medical professional about the dangers of radon** exposure and learn that lung cancer is not only caused by smoking. 

***\~Janet*** 

**Fund research initiatives to better understand the impacts of radon** exposure and the effectiveness of various mitigation techniques. This could also include studies on geographic risk factors and vulnerable populations. ***\~MaryAnn***  
**7 8**   
**Establish a comprehensive data collection system for radon** levels across the country to monitor trends and identify high-risk areas more effectively. 

***\~MaryAnn*** 

**Collaborate with local authorities to create customized radon management strategies** that consider regional geology and population density, ensuring 

effective communication and response. 

***\~MaryAnn*** 

**9**   
Invest in more **clinical trials and research** that can detect lung cancer and radon exposure earlier. 

***\~Kelly*** 

**REGULATE** 

**10**   
Establish and enforce regulations that require **radon mitigation systems to be installed in new homes** and after renovations. Provide guidance on best 

practices for radon mitigation systems. 

***\~MaryAnn*** 

**11 *\~MaryAnn***   
Review and **update radon exposure guidelines and public safety policies** regularly, taking into consideration new research findings and health 

recommendations. 

**12** Create a **federal mandate for schools, daycares, and business to require radon**   
**testing** to be done. It is simple and inexpensive, and if there is a problem it can be easily remedied for a few thousand dollars depending on the size of the 

home. 

***\~Janet*** 

**13 *\~Kelly***   
Revise **National Building Codes to have new homes radon tested after construction** as many consumers are unaware that, despite having a radon rough-in, an installation fan needs to be activated.  

**14 *\~Janet***   
**Implement a lung cancer screening program with low dose CT scans** to detect lung cancer early. The program would initially include high risk groups including smokers, firefighters, those with family history of cancer, etc. Screening already exists for breast, colon, and prostate cancers, but not for lung cancer.

**Anyone with Lungs can get Lung Cancer** 

There are various carcinogens that have been linked to lung cancer development. These include smoking, exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, & air pollutants, and can also include genetic predispositions. Individuals who smoke are at the greatest risk of developing lung cancer.  

**No matter what the cause of someone’s lung cancer may be, it is important to provide them with the same level of respect, care, and support throughout their journey.** 

How to Test Your Home for Radon 

Testing your home for radon is easy, inexpensive, and can save lives. 

Purchase a long-term radon test today to measure the levels of radon 

gas within your home.

My Home Tested High for Radon, 

Now What? 

Radon gas is measured in becquerels per cubic meter (Bq/m3). **Health** 

**Canada recommends mitigating your home if your radon test detects** 

**levels over 200 Bq/m3**. Canada is a radon hotspot, with over 10 million 

homes testing over this 200 Bq/m3 threshold.
