I’m a 64-year old retired Emergency Dispatcher and medic, who enjoys travelling and has visited many countries. On one of my most recent trips, I was hiking in Peru when I began to feel unwell. Initially, I thought it was due to the increased elevation, but I quickly became lethargic and short of breath. Upon returning home, I had a chest X-ray done in December 2023, which revealed a consider able mass in my upper right lobe. I was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. The diagnosis hit me hard, especially since I had always been active and had never smoked. I hiked, biked, and lived a healthy life. I didn’t expect this, especially not lung cancer. After my diagnosis, I researched lung cancer causes and discovered that radon is the second leading cause of the disease. I didn’t know much about it before, but after finding information on Lung Saskatchewan’s website, I ordered a radon test kit.

The results were shocking: the radon levels in my home were over 500 Bq/m³ (Becquerel per cubic meter), more than double the 200 Bq/m³ limit recommended by Health Canada. I had no idea about this hidden threat, and it was a wake-up call. I’m grateful I tested my home, but it breaks my heart to think this lung cancer could have been prevented. If only I had known how easy it was to test my home and fix the high radon levels. After seeing those alarming radon test results, I took action to mitigate the radon levels in my home to ensure it was safe. Fixing the problem was quick and affordable. It was a huge relief to take control of at least one factor affecting my health. I truly believe radon exposure is the reason I was diagnosed with lung cancer.

Now, I’m on immunotherapy, and while some days are exhausting, I’m grateful for the treatment. The side effects are manageable, and it’s been a better choice for me than chemotherapy or radiation. When my doctor suggested immunotherapy, it just felt right. I didn’t hesitate.

Living with lung cancer has changed my life in many ways. Even simple tasks like climbing stairs can be a challenge. I live alone, and everyday chores have become challenging. My energy is low, and I can no longer engage in athletic activities, such as riding my bike along the river or camping. I will also be unable to continue with my retirement plans of traveling for 2–3 months a year because of my two-year immunotherapy treatment plan. Being a lung cancer ambassador is important to me because I believe no one should get lung cancer from radon as it can be prevented. I wish all Canadians knew the importance of getting their homes tested for radon before it’s too late. If sharing my story helps just one family avoid what I’m going through, it will have been worth it. I would like to see the government protect citizens by making radon testing mandatory and providing relief to families so everyone can live in healthier environments.

If more people knew about the dangers of radon exposure and took action, much suffering could be prevented. I can’t stress enough how important organizations like Lung Saskatchewan are. They provide resources and support that many don’t even realize are available. I didn’t know until I needed them, and I’m incredibly grateful for their help.

If there’s one thing I hope you take away from my story, it’s this: prevention is everything. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Take care of your health, your home, and your loved ones. We all have the power to make a difference. Testing your home for radon is a simple step that could save lives.
