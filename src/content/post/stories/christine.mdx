My name is Christine Elliott, and I am an author and speaker, and I mentor people who have experienced disease, disaster, or adversity. My journey as a two-time cancer survivor enables me to connect with people on a personal level.

My lung cancer was discovered through extensive testing. Initially, I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer, and due to the severity, further tests were done to check for metastasis. Alarmingly, cancer was found in the lower lobe of my lung, and surgery was performed shortly after to remove it. When the pathology results came in, my surgeon was surprised to find that, the lung cancer was a separate case, not related to my breast cancer. Since I did not smoke or grow up around farm chemicals, the likely cause was radon gas. That was the first time I had heard of radon.

Five years earlier, my stepdad was diagnosed with lung cancer at 57 and sadly passed away within two months. Since he had lived a very healthy life, it was confusing for all of us. When I was diagnosed with lung cancer years later, I connected the dots—we had both lived in the same home. I received a radon test kit from Lung Saskatchewan and brought it to my childhood home. The new owners kindly agreed to place the kit in the house, and the results indicated high radon levels. This revelation was a big red flag for me.

Lung and breast cancer have affected every aspect of my life. I live with lasting side effects, and the fear of recurrence is always present. The impact of cancer is immense, influencing every part of my life—family, finances, emotions, and physical well-being. I continue to heal slowly from these effects. I want to be an ambassador to raise awareness about radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer. By educating others, I hope to give families a fighting chance. Canadians need to understand how prevalent radon is in homes; every house in Canada has some level of radon. The important question is how high the radon levels are, and the only way to find out is to test.

To protect Canadians from radon exposure and prevent lung cancer, the government should prioritize raising awareness about this hidden danger. Many Canadians are unaware of radon’s presence in homes, and the combination of ignorance and the cost of mitigation prevents many from taking action. Government support for mitigation costs would make a significant difference. While this will take time, addressing the issue now can prevent future suffering and reduce the financial burden of lung cancer treatment. I want people to be aware of radon so they can protect themselves from its dangers and save lives.
