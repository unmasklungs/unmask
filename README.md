```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command             | Action                                             |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`       | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev`       | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`        |
| `npm run build`     | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
| `npm run preview`   | Preview your build locally, before deploying       |
| `npm run check`     | Check your project for errors                      |
