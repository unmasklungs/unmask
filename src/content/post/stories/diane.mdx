My name is Diane Colton. I am a three-time cancer of the lungs survivor, the Creator, Founder, and Chair of the Unmasking the Reality of Lung Cancer Society and owner of Mobility Financial Services Inc. I am also an internationally recognized patient advocate for cancer of the lungs and sit on several advisory committees and projects related to the disease.

In 2011, I was diagnosed for the first time My only symptom was coughing up blood, which led me to the emergency room. After several hours, I had an X-ray followed by a CT scan. The emergency room doctor walked in, told me I had lung cancer, turned around, and left. It was 5 a.m., and I was completely alone. Five weeks later a lobectomy was performed on Dec 6, 2011 to remove my upper left lobe and the 3.6 cm tumor, which is where my 3.6cm tumor had taken up residence. Thankfully no further treatments were needed, and I returned to work on February 15, 2012. I had a business to run and air to breath!

Five months later, in July 2012, I was diagnosed a second time, with cancer appearing in two lymph nodes in my upper right groin. I under went 10 targeted radiation treatments. Again no other treatments were necessary.

I first heard about radon and its potential health risks in 2014 when I was fortunate enough to meet Dr. Aaron Goodarzi. We discussed radon and its effects, and in 2015, I formed charitable organization called Unmasking the Reality of Lung Cancer and held my first educational public event, which included information on radon, early screening, and tumour data from the University of Calgary. Since then, I have been actively engaged with raising awareness about radon and giving it the attention it deserves.

In August 2019, I was diagnosed with brain a metastasis in the left occipital region. I received three stereotactic treatments, but no additional treatments were required. To date, there has been no recurrence.

Throughout my treatments, I kept working on my numerous projects surrounding radon and the reality that is cancer of the lungs, as well are growing my business. In February 2020 after receiving a clean bill of health, we held our second Unmasking the Reality of Lung Cancer Society gala.

In facing my diagnosis’, I took any anger I had and channeled it into positive action. Educating and helping people understand cancer of the lungs and the challenges those diagnosed face. Everyone reacts differently to hearing about cancer of the lungs, and most people would not have done any reading or research about it, unless it directly impacted their lives. I certainly hadn’t. So, I don’t expect the public to be well-versed in either cancer of the lungs or radon unless it has had a direct impact on their life! What we don't know can't hurt us... right?

The silver lining of this diagnosis is I have the opportunity to design my life to how I truly want it to be every day when I wake up. I do my best to live in sync with my cancer; it’s part of my life.

There are so many wonderful people, places, and events surrounding each of us. I may have another 30 years, but then, I may have only three days. I have no control over that, but I do have control over how I live want each moment to count.

Cancer of the lungs is an equal opportunity disease, but we can ensure future generations don’t have to be in capacitated because of it. There are very simple and effective ways to prevent this. The government is accountable for what they do—or don’t do. They have all the data about radon, its effects, and the cost- effective solutions to address it. I am fortunate in how my cancer of the lungs journey has played out. I have the health and capacity to work towards enacting change and creating a brighter future where taking a breath is a joy. Because I have been as fortunate as I am I have chosen to invest in the cancer of the lungs community.

For most people, with cancer of the lungs, the road is painful and a daily struggle just to breathe. Hold your breath longer than you can, and you’ll understand what so many go through every day. The fix is easy. The economy will be better for it, people will be better for it, the future will be better for it, and the country and those who represent it will be better for it.

I never asked for cancer of the lungs, and it was definitely not in my day timer! Yes! I’d love for it to go away and never return, but it’s a strange bedfellow, but has allowed me with the ability to impact the the lives and the world that is cancer of the lungs. How I live each day and what I leave behind will always drive me; I want to change the landscape of cancer of the lungs as much as my abilities allow. I’m grateful for each breath, for the opportunity to share my story, and for everyone who reads this, and even for those who don’t.
