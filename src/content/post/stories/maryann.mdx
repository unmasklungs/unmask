My name is MaryAnn Bradley, and I have dedicated myself to advocating for lung cancer awareness and improved care, over the past decade. My journey in this field has led me to take on various roles with the Canadian Cancer Society, the Lung Health Foundation, the Canadian Cancer Survivor Network, and Right2Survive.

Throughout these years, I have been privileged to make meaningful contributions to the lung cancer community. One of my most significant achievements has been engaging with government officials to advocate for critical changes in drug approval processes for lung cancer treatments. My efforts have also focused on promoting cleaner air quality and pushing for stricter regulations on vaping. Additionally, I have spoken to our provincial legislature on the significance of early screening for lung cancer and the importance of testing for radon in Ontario.

My work is driven by a deep commitment to ensuring that those affected by lung cancer have access to the best possible care and that preventive measures are in place to protect future generations.

In 2014, my life took an unexpected turn when I began experiencing persistent pain on the left side of my carotid artery. For six months, I endured this discomfort, which led to a variety of tests. Despite these efforts, no clear answers emerged, and the pain continued to worsen until it became unbearable.

Finally, I made the difficult decision to go to the emergency room, hoping to find some relief. It was there, amidst the uncertainty and fear, that my journey took a dramatic shift. After being admitted to the hospital, I learned that my X-ray had revealed a shadow on the right upper lobe of my lung. This finding prompted further investigation, and a subsequent CT scan confirmed the presence of a 2.7 cm cancerous lesion.

In that moment, the word "cancer" entered my life, forever changing the path I would walk. The diagnosis of lung cancer was a shock, but it also ignited a fire within me — a determination to not only fight my own battle but to advocate for others facing the same struggle.

My story is not just about the pain and fear of a diagnosis but also about the strength and resilience that can emerge from it. It is a testament to the importance of early detection, the need for better patient care, and the ongoing fight for cleaner air and stronger regulations on health risks like vaping and radon.

I don't know exactly how or why I developed lung cancer, but I grew up in a time when smoking was everywhere and seen as the "cool" thing to do. It wasn't just a personal choice; it was a part of the environment. About five years ago, I also became aware of radon — a colourless, odourless gas that can be deadly.

Despite its dangers, the information available to me back then was limited. I learned that radon exposure, especially in homes — whether old or new — could lead to lung cancer. This realization added another layer to my understanding of lung cancer risk factors and highlighted the need for greater public awareness and government action. The combination of a lifetime surrounded by smoke and the potential exposure to radon has left me questioning how many others might be unknowingly at risk.

Being a lung cancer ambassador is important to me because it allows me to give a voice to those affected by this disease, including myself. It's also about raising awareness and dispelling the myths that surround lung cancer. Many people still associate lung cancer solely with smoking, but there are countless other factors, like radon exposure and environmental pollutants, that contribute to the disease. As an ambassador, I can help educate the public, reduce stigma, and push for stronger regulations to protect future generations.

Ultimately, being a lung cancer ambassador is my way of turning my personal experience into positive action, helping to drive change, and supporting the lung cancer community in meaningful ways.

I wish all Canadians knew that lung cancer can affect anyone, regardless of their smoking history. If you have lungs, you can get lung cancer. It’s as simple as that.

To effectively protect Canadians from the dangers of radon and reduce the risk of lung cancer, the government should consider the following actions:

1. Nationwide Radon Testing Programs
2. Public Awareness Campaigns
3. Radon Mitigation Standards
4. Support for Research
5. Collaboration with Health Authorities:
6. Enhanced Building Codes
7. Long-term Monitoring and Data Collection
8. Financial Assistance for Mitigation
9. Partnerships with Local Governments
10. Regular Updates to Policies

By implementing a combination of these strategies, the government can significantly reduce radon-related health risks and protect Canadians from the dangers of lung cancer associated with radon exposure.
