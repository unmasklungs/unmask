**Luana Hiebert, Saskatoon, SK** 

***I***’m a 64-year old retired Emergency Dispatcher and medic, who enjoys travelling and has visited many countries. On one of my most recent trips, I was hiking in Peru when I began to feel unwell. Initially, I thought it was due to the increased elevation, but I quickly became lethargic and short of breath. Upon returning home, I had a chest X-ray done in December 2023, which revealed a consider able mass in my upper right lobe. I was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. The diagnosis hit me hard, especially since I had always been active and had never smoked. I hiked, biked, and lived a healthy life. I didn’t expect this, especially not lung cancer. After my diagnosis, I researched lung cancer causes and discovered that radon is the second leading cause of the disease. I didn’t know much about it before, but after finding information on Lung Saskatchewan’s website, I ordered a radon test kit. 

The results were shocking: the radon levels in my home were over 500 Bq/m³ (Becquerel per cubic meter), more than double the 200 Bq/m³ limit recommended by Health Canada. I had no idea about this hidden threat, and it was a wake-up call. I’m grateful I tested my home, but it breaks my heart to think this lung cancer could have been prevented. If only I had known how easy it was to test my home and fix the high radon levels. After seeing those alarming radon test results, I took action to mitigate the radon levels in my home to ensure it was safe. Fixing the problem was quick and affordable. It was a huge relief to   
take control of at least one factor affecting my health. I truly believe radon exposure is the reason I was diagnosed with lung cancer. 

Now, I’m on immunotherapy, and while some days are exhausting, I’m grateful for the treatment. The side effects are manageable, and it’s been a better choice for me than chemotherapy or radiation. When my doctor suggested immunotherapy, it just felt right. I didn’t hesitate. 

Living with lung cancer has changed my life in many ways. Even simple tasks like climbing stairs can be a challenge. I live alone, and everyday chores have become challenging. My energy is low, and I can no longer engage in athletic activities, such as riding my bike along the river or camping. I will also be unable to continue with my retirement plans of traveling for 2–3 months a year because of my two-year immunotherapy treatment plan. Being a lung cancer ambassador is important to me because I believe no one should get lung cancer from radon as it can be prevented. I wish all Canadians knew the importance of getting their homes tested for radon before it’s too late. If sharing my story helps just one family avoid what I’m going through, it will have been worth it. I would like to see the government protect citizens by making radon testing mandatory and providing relief to families so everyone can live in healthier environments. 

If more people knew about the dangers of radon exposure and took action, much suffering could be prevented. I can’t stress 

enough how important organizations like Lung Saskatchewan are. They provide resources and support that many don’t even realize are available. I didn’t know until I needed them, and I’m incredibly grateful for their help. 

If there’s one thing I hope you take away from my story, it’s this: prevention is everything. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Take care of your health, your home, and your loved ones. We all have the power to make a difference. Testing your home for radon is a simple step   
4 that could save lives.

**Kerri Mossing, Saskatoon, SK** 

***M***y name is Kerri Mossing, and I am a real estate agent from Saskatoon. I am a mom to three awesome kids, Liam (20), Avery (18), and Joren (15). This fall, I married my partner Trevor who has two great kids of his own. I was diagnosed with Stage 2 lung cancer in 2019 at the age of 41\. Being someone who had never smoked, this came as an incredible shock to me and my family. 

About a year prior to getting sick, I had developed a persistent cough. I talked to my doctor, and we thought it might be related to my seasonal allergies. I was prescribed an inhaler, which seemed to help at the time. In the summer of 2019, I had symptoms of pneumonia prompting my doctor to order a X-ray. The X-ray showed what was thought to be a significant infection in my right lung. I was prescribed an antibiotic and told to return for a follow up x-ray in four weeks. Three weeks later, I was feeling significantly worse and was coughing so much that I could not eat or drink. I went back to the doctor, and they sent me for a follow up X-ray. I received a call very quickly that day and was told that this did not seem to be only related to pneumonia, and that a CT scan and shortly thereafter, a PET scan were ordered. The PET scan showed that the spot on my lung was very worrisome, and a biopsy was ordered. After the (very painful) CT guided biopsy, my surgeon called to say that cancer had been found and it was believed to be stage 1\.   
A surgery date was set to remove the lower lobe of my right lung. Unfortunately, during the surgery, it was discovered that the cancer had invaded some lymph nodes in the area and the tumor was larger than they had initially thought. At this time, it was deemed Stage 2B and I was referred to an oncologist who told me chemotherapy would be the next course of action. I endured four rounds of chemotherapy at the Cancer Clinic in Saskatoon which ended in February of 2020\. I have been having scans and X-rays regularly since then, and in early 2025, I will be five years cancer free\! 

My children at the time were 15, 13, and 10, so it was very hard to have to explain to them that I had cancer. It was a very frightening time for us all, especially once we found out that it had spread, and chemotherapy was prescribed. Going through chemotherapy was very difficult, and as a single mom at the time, it was 

challenging to be present for my kids while being so sick. Thankfully, I have a wonderful support system of family and friends who could help. 

Given that I have never smoked, had no history of being around much second-hand smoke, and had never worked in any environments with high levels of asbestos, radon exposure is highly likely the cause of my lung cancer. 

I had heard of radon at a seminar put on by Lung Saskatchewan for realtors about a year prior to my diagnosis. At that time, I remember making a joke to my friend that maybe that's why I was having this nagging cough. After my diagnosis, I immediately connected with Lung 

Saskatchewan and started my journey of education, awareness, and telling my story. 

I tested my current home for radon, and my levels were at 130 Bq/m3. Since then, I mitigated my home for radon because I wanted the radon levels to be as low as possible to reduce my family's risk. I do not know if one of our previous homes was high, but I assume this to be the case, given the cancer diagnosis. I wanted to do anything possible to try to avoid a future diagnosis for anyone else in my home. I am very thankful to be cancer free today and 5*Continued on page 6 ...* 

*![][image5]*

 Why should I have lung cancer? I had no known 

risk factors for lung cancer. I then discovered 

we live in an area known to have some of the 

highest radon levels in Canada and in fact the 

world. I immediately tested my home of 25 

years. I was shocked to find home radon levels 

consistently higher than Health Canada’s 

guideline level of 200 Bq/m³ (becquerels per 

cubic metre). 

The irony of the situation isn’t lost on me. Lung 

cancer is one of the most preventable types of 

cancer. I should have tested and acted years 

ago to protect myself and my family. Once we 

confirmed the high radon levels, I took steps to 

reduce them through a process called radon 

mitigation. It’s so relieving and reassuring 

knowing that our home is now safe. We are 

so grateful to all the health care providers and 

radon professionals on my lung cancer journey. 

I am grateful to have caught my cancer 

early and had it successfully removed. I feel 

compelled to share my story to raise 

awareness about the life-threatening risks 

of radon. I wouldn’t wish this diagnosis on 

anyone. I urge every homeowner to protect 

their family’s health by checking for radon 

and taking any required mitigation measures. 

Together, we can prevent lung cancer and 

protect our loved ones from this silent danger.

I am grateful that my cancer was caught early  as most people are diagnosed very late. I am  dedicated to sharing my story and raising  awareness about radon so that more people  will test their homes and do what they can to  avoid a cancer diagnosis. 

I want Canadians to know that lung cancer  from radon exposure is preventable. Everyone  with lungs can get lung cancer. Testing is easy  and reducing radon in your home should be  important to everyone. 

**Dr. Kong E. Khoo, Kelowna, BC** 

***I***n early 2020, I was diagnosed with stage 1 lung cancer coincidentally after routine follow-up for an unrelated chronic condition found a series of abnormalities. The news was shocking, especially for someone who sees the devastating effects of cancer on patients every day. I am a Medical Oncologist at the British Columbia Cancer Agency \- Kelowna and I also Clinical Assistant Professor at University of British Columbia. We were all in the throes of the COVID pandemic at the time. I eventually had surgery to remove the cancer later that year and had half my right lung removed. When the pathology report came back confirming lung cancer, it just dawned on me that it could be radon related.

**Kelly Graham-Miele,**  

**East St. Paul, Manitoba** 

***M***y name is Kelly Graham-Miele. I recently retired from a 30-year career as a Residential Decorating evening instructor at Red River College and my design consultation business. Currently, I do administrative work for a family run business while supporting cancer patients through advocacy and volunteering. 

In 2013, due to my smoking history, I asked my doctor if I could be tested for lung cancer. I had promised my kids that I would ask during my annual physical appointment, because they had recently learned about smoking and lung cancer in school, and they were quite concerned about my health. The doctor was reluctant to order a chest X-ray since I had no symptoms, however, I pressed the issue explaining that I had promised my kids and had quit smoking 

again, so the doctor finally agreed. 

Sadly, the X-ray showed something unusual, so I was sent for a CT scan, then a biopsy which confirmed my lung cancer diagnosis of stage 3A Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. I was referred to Cancercare Manitoba and underwent extensive daily radiation and chemotherapy. Following all my treatments, I advocated for surgery. The surgeon agreed to operate if further testing was done, including a brain CT scan, PET scan, and breathing test which had not been at time of my original diagnosis. On St. Patrick’s Day 2014, I had a mid-lobe resection and a decade later, I celebrate this day as my cancer-versary\!   
Initially, I thought the cause of my lung cancer  was from my smoking history. As a result of  the stigma surrounding lung cancer, I hid my  diagnosis from almost everyone except for my  husband, children, and a few family members.  I felt embarrassed and ashamed of my poor  lifestyle choices but more importantly, I wanted to protect my children from the lack of cancer compassion and care often  shown to lung cancer patients. 

Additionally, because of my poor prognosis  of less than 17% of a 5-year survival rate, I wanted to spend my remaining time enjoying  my children’s activities and leading as normal  a life as possible. I hid my bald head behind a  wig, and actually worked part-time during my  treatments, and pretended everything was  okay, even though it really was not. 

During my journey, I reached out to the Lung  Health Research Foundation in the USA and was  invited to attend a conference. Surprisingly,  I learned that adenocarcinoma, unlike other  forms of lung cancer, is not always associated  with smoking. Also, it most commonly occurs in  younger women who have never smoked. I was  never told this, nor was I told about radon or  advised to test my home as the effects of radon  are multiplied considerably if you have a  smoking history. I was horrified that despite  undergoing extensive radiation, chemotherapy,  and surgery, I could have been living in a home  with high radon levels that possibly caused my  lung cancer\! 

This is one of the main reasons that I advocate  in both the public and health care setting \-- to  raise awareness that lung cancer is not just a  smoker's disease, and that anyone diagnosed  with lung cancer should have their homes  tested for radon. The World Health  Organization tells us that “radon is much  more likely to cause lung cancer in people  who smoke. In fact, smokers are estimated  to be 25 times more at risk from radon than  non-smokers.” *Continued on page 8 ...* 7  
*... continued from page 7 \[Kelly Graham\].*   
*![][image7]![][image8]*  
Advocating as a Lung Cancer Ambassador is  

important to me because: 

1\. I want to debunk the misconception that 

lung cancer is only caused by smoking. 

2\. Lung Cancer has a low 5-year survival 

rate and a high reoccurrencerate. Patients, 

after undergoing treatment, should have 

their homes tested to avoid re-exposure to 

high radon levels. 

3\. I want people to know if you have lungs, 

you can get lung cancer. Let’s reduce the 

stigma associated with lung cancer. 

4\. Lung cancer kills more Canadian's 

annually than colon, breast, and prostate 

combined so let's make sure the funding 

for lung cancer screening reflects this\! 

I would like Canadians to know that radon 

gas is the second leading cause of lung 

cancer\! Canada is one of several countries 

with some of the highest radon levels in 

the world. 



**Diane Colton, Calgary AB** (Our Founder)

***M***y name is Diane Colton. I am a three-time cancer of the lungs survivor, the Creator,  Founder, and Chair of the Unmasking the  Reality of Lung Cancer Society and owner of  Mobility Financial Services Inc. I am also an  internationally recognized patient advocate for  cancer of the lungs and sit on several advisory  committees and projects related to the disease. 

In 2011, I was diagnosed for the first time My  only symptom was coughing up blood, which  led me to the emergency room. After several  hours, I had an X-ray followed by a CT scan.  

The emergency room doctor walked in, told me  I had lung cancer, turned around, and left. It was  5 a.m., and I was completely alone. Five weeks  later a lobectomy was performed on Dec 6,  2011 to remove my upper left lobe and the 3.6  cm tumor, which is where my 3.6cm tumor had  taken up residence. Thankfully no further  treatments were needed, and I returned to work  on February 15, 2012\. I had a business to run  and air to breath\! 

Five months later, in July 2012, I was diagnosed  a second time, with cancer appearing in two  lymph nodes in my upper right groin. I under went 10 targeted radiation treatments. Again  no other treatments were necessary. 

I first heard about radon and its potential health  risks in 2014 when I was fortunate enough to  meet Dr. Aaron Goodarzi. We discussed radon  and its effects, and in 2015, I formed charitable  organization called Unmasking the Reality of   
Lung Cancer and held my first educational  public event, which included information on  radon, early screening, and tumour data from  the University of Calgary. Since then, I have  been actively engaged with raising awareness  about radon and giving it the attention it  deserves. 

In August 2019, I was diagnosed with brain  a metastasis in the left occipital region.  I received three stereotactic treatments, but  no additional treatments were required.  To date, there has been no recurrence. 

Throughout my treatments, I kept working on  my numerous projects surrounding radon and  the reality that is cancer of the lungs, as well  are growing my business. In February 2020  after receiving a clean bill of health, we held  our second Unmasking the Reality of Lung  Cancer Society gala. 

In facing my diagnosis’, I took any anger I had  and channeled it into positive action. Educating  and helping people understand cancer of the  lungs and the challenges those diagnosed face.  Everyone reacts differently to hearing about  cancer of the lungs, and most people would not  have done any reading or research about it,  unless it directly impacted their lives. I certainly  hadn’t. So, I don’t expect the public to be  well-versed in either cancer of the lungs or  radon unless it has had a direct impact on their  life\! What we don't know can't hurt us... right? 

The silver lining of this diagnosis is I have the  opportunity to design my life to how I truly  want it to be every day when I wake up. I do my  best to live in sync with my cancer; it’s part of  my life. 

There are so many wonderful people, places,  and events surrounding each of us. I may have  another 30 years, but then, I may have only  three days. I have no control over that, but I do  have control over how I live want each moment to count.

Cancer of the lungs is an equal opportunity disease, but we can ensure  future generations don’t have to be in capacitated because of it. There are very  simple and effective ways to prevent this.  The government is accountable for what  they do—or don’t do. They have all the  data about radon, its effects, and the  cost- effective solutions to address it.  I am fortunate in how my cancer of the  lungs journey has played out. I have the  health and capacity to work towards  enacting change and creating a brighter  future where taking a breath is a joy.  Because I have been as fortunate as I  am I have chosen to invest in the cancer  of the lungs community.  

For most people, with cancer of the  lungs, the road is painful and a daily  struggle just to breathe. Hold your  breath longer than you can, and you’ll 

understand what so many go through  every day. The fix is easy. The economy  will be better for it, people will be better  for it, the future will be better for it, and  the country and those who represent it  will be better for it.  

I never asked for cancer of the lungs,  and it was definitely not in my day timer\!  Yes\! I’d love for it to go away and never  return, but it’s a strange bedfellow, but  has allowed me with the ability to impact  the the lives and the world that is cancer  of the lungs. How I live each day and  what I leave behind will always drive  me; I want to change the landscape of  cancer of the lungs as much as my  abilities allow. I’m grateful for each  breath, for the opportunity to share my  story, and for everyone who reads this,  and even for those who don’t.

**Christine Elliott, Dundurn, SK** 

***M***y name is Christine Elliott, and I am an author and speaker, and I mentor people who have experienced disease, disaster, or adversity. My journey as a two-time cancer survivor enables me to connect with people on a personal level. 

My lung cancer was discovered through extensive testing. Initially, I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer, and due to the severity, further tests were done to check for metastasis. Alarmingly, cancer was found in the lower lobe of my lung, and surgery was performed shortly after to remove it. When the pathology results came in, my surgeon was surprised to find that, the lung cancer was a separate case, not related to my breast cancer. Since I did not smoke or grow up around farm chemicals, the likely cause was radon gas. That was the first 

time I had heard of radon. 

Five years earlier, my stepdad was diagnosed with lung cancer at 57 and sadly passed away within two months. Since he had lived a very healthy life, it was confusing for all of us. When I was diagnosed with lung cancer years 

later, I connected the dots—we had both lived in the same home. I received a radon test kit from Lung Saskatchewan and brought it to my childhood home. The new owners kindly 

13  
agreed to place the kit in the house, and the results indicated high radon levels. This revelation was a big red flag for me. 

Lung and breast cancer have affected every aspect of my life. I live with lasting side effects, and the fear of recurrence is always present. The impact of cancer is immense, 

influencing every part of my life—family, finances, emotions, and physical well-being. I continue to heal slowly from these effects. I want to be an ambassador to raise awareness about radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer. By educating others, I hope to give families a fighting chance. Canadians need to understand how prevalent radon is in homes; every house in Canada has some level of radon. The important question is how high the radon levels are, and the only way to find out is to test. 

To protect Canadians from radon exposure and prevent lung cancer, the government should prioritize raising awareness about this hidden danger. Many Canadians are unaware of radon’s presence in homes, and the combination of ignorance and the cost of mitigation prevents many from taking action. Government support for mitigation costs would make a significant difference. While this will take time, addressing the issue now can prevent future suffering and reduce the financial burden of lung cancer treatment. I want people to be aware of radon so they can protect themselves from its dangers and save lives. 

**MaryAnn Bradley, St. Catharines, ON**   
***M***y name is MaryAnn Bradley, and I have dedicated myself to advocating for lung cancer awareness and improved care, over the past decade. My journey in this field has led me to take on various roles with the Canadian Cancer Society, the Lung Health Foundation, the Canadian Cancer Survivor Network, and Right2Survive. 

Throughout these years, I have been privileged to make meaningful contributions to the lung cancer community. One of my most significant achievements has been engaging with government officials to advocate for critical changes in drug approval processes for lung cancer treatments. My efforts have also focused on promoting cleaner air quality and pushing for stricter regulations on vaping. Additionally, I have spoken to our provincial legislature on the significance of early screening for lung cancer and the importance of testing for radon in Ontario. 

My work is driven by a deep commitment to ensuring that those affected by lung cancer have access to the best possible care and that preventive measures are in place to protect future generations. 

In 2014, my life took an unexpected turn when I began experiencing persistent pain on the left side of my carotid artery. For six months, I endured this discomfort, which led to a variety of tests. Despite these efforts, no clear answers emerged, and the pain continued to worsen until it became unbearable.   
Finally, I made the difficult decision to go to the emergency room, hoping to find some relief. It was there, amidst the uncertainty 

and fear, that my journey took a dramatic shift. After being admitted to the hospital, I learned that my X-ray had revealed a shadow on the right upper lobe of my lung. This finding prompted further investigation, and a subsequent CT scan confirmed the presence of a 2.7 cm cancerous lesion. 

In that moment, the word "cancer" entered my life, forever changing the path I would walk. The diagnosis of lung cancer was a shock, but it also ignited a fire within me — a determination to not only fight my own battle but to advocate for others facing the same struggle. 

 My story is not just about the pain and fear of a diagnosis but also about the strength and resilience that can emerge from it. It is a testament to the importance of early detection, the need for better patient care, and the ongoing fight for cleaner air and stronger regulations on health risks like vaping and radon. 

I don't know exactly how or why I developed lung cancer, but I grew up in a time when smoking was everywhere and seen as the "cool" thing to do. It wasn't just a personal choice; it was a part of the environment. About five years ago, I also became aware of radon — a colourless, odourless gas that can be deadly. 

Despite its dangers, the information available to me back then was limited. I learned that radon exposure, especially in homes — whether old or new — could lead to lung cancer. This realization added another layer to my understanding of lung cancer risk factors and highlighted the need for greater public awareness and government action. The combination of a lifetime surrounded by smoke and the potential exposure to radon has left me questioning how many others might be unknowingly at risk.  

*Continued on page 16 ...*

*... continued from page 15\. \[MaryAnn Bradley\]* 

Being a lung cancer ambassador is important to me because it allows me to give a voice to those affected by this disease, including myself. It's also about raising awareness and dispelling the myths that surround lung cancer. Many people still associate lung cancer solely with smoking, but there are countless other factors, like radon exposure and environmental pollutants, that contribute to the disease. As an ambassador, I can help educate the public, reduce stigma, and push for stronger regulations to protect future generations. 

Ultimately, being a lung cancer ambassador is my way of turning my personal experience into positive action, helping to drive change, and supporting the lung cancer community in meaningful ways. 

I wish all Canadians knew that lung cancer can affect anyone, regardless of their smoking history. If you have lungs, you can get lung cancer. It’s as simple as that. 

To effectively protect Canadians from the dangers of radon and reduce the risk of lung cancer, the government should consider the following actions: 

1\. Nationwide Radon Testing Programs 

2\. Public Awareness Campaigns 

3\. Radon Mitigation Standards 

4\. Support for Research 

5\. Collaboration with Health Authorities: 6\. Enhanced Building Codes 

7\. Long-term Monitoring and Data Collection 8\. Financial Assistance for Mitigation 

9\. Partnerships with Local Governments 10\. Regular Updates to Policies 

By implementing a combination of these strategies, the government can significantly reduce radon-related health risks and protect Canadians from the dangers of lung cancer associated with radon exposure.

**Janet Whitehead, Coquitlamn BC** 

***M***y name is Janet Whitehead, and I currently 

live in Coquitlam, BC. I previously had a career 

in interior design, and I currently provide 

administrative support for our family business. 

I found out I had lung cancer after a visit 

to my family doctor. I had a constant dry cough 

and breathlessness. He referred me for stress 

tests for my heart as I had never smoked or 

worked around people who did. The tests 

showed my heart was healthy. As the 

symptoms persisted, he sent me for an X-ray, 

which showed a tumour in the upper left lobe. 

Following a biopsy which was positive for 

cancer, I underwent surgery to remove the 

upper left lobe, part of the lower left lobe, 

and lymph nodes at Vancouver General 

Hospital. Three months later I had a second 

surgery on the right lung to remove two 

additional cancerous growths. 

My cancer was radon-induced, caused by 

exposure to high levels of radon gas (which 

is radioactive) in the home we lived in for 

five years, in Ottawa. The Health Canada 

Radon Action Guideline for radon gas in your 

home is 200 Bq/m3 and the World Health 

Organization (WHO) guidance is even lower at 

100 Bq/m3 . The WHO states “there is no level, 

below which, exposure to radon can be 

considered safe” which simply put, means 

there are no safe levels of radon. 

17  
My husband sent a radon test to the homes we had lived in Ottawa and Cornwall in Ontario. The Ottawa home tested extremely high for radon at 3,200 Bq/m3, equivalent to 32 times the WHO guideline and 16 times the Health Canada guidance. The current homeowners at the time were a family with three young children. The homeowner immediately had the home successfully mitigated to below 100 Bq/m3. I have been aware of radon since 2007, when my husband co-founded a business in Vancouver, whose goal is to raise public awareness and education about the health risks associated with exposure to radon and provide testing and mitigation solutions. The only way to know how much radon is in your home is to test, so please test your home today\! 

My lung cancer was caught early, and I made a full recovery. I continue to have CT scans every two years to monitor my lungs. The largest adjustment I’ve had to make is managing my pace to function with essentially one lung, while being active. I have a cough that never goes away, and I have asthma. External air quality affects me, so the smoke from forest fires affects my breathing significantly. 

 The public needs to be better informed about the dangers of radon gas, which is present in every indoor environment to some degree. Unless people test their homes for radon, they do not know if they, or their children and pets, are being exposed to this radioactive gas. All Canadians need to take this seriously, as radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer and radon-induced lung cancer is preventable. 

 The public health ministers, both provincial and federal, need to treat this major health risk with the seriousness it deserves. Most politicians don’t know about radon gas and that it is a major lung health risk across Canada. Schools and daycares also need to be tested. I would like to see a federal mandate for schools, day cares, and public businesses to require testing. 

*Continued on page 18 ...*   
*... continued from page 17\. \[Janet Whitehead\]* 

I would also like medical professionals at the 

general practitioner level to treat this seriously 

and learn about the dangers of radon exposure. 

Lung cancer due to radon is the second leading 

cause of lung cancer and more doctors need to 

be educated about this.
